# A Tutorial on Pointers and Arrays in C

This repository contains the examples for all chapters
of A Tutorial on Pointers and Arrays in C by Ted Jensen.
I used C and Vim on a Fedora 36 system in a VirtualBox
environment to create, use, and manage directories and
files as I work through Jensen's A Tutorial on Pointers
and Arrays in C textbook.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any 
questions or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize
the source code for your consumption or edification.
